# Resource bundle for all strings, messages, and other resources the applet uses

# When changing resource bundle keys, make sure you CHANGE AppletResources.properties FIRST,
# and only then modify the locale specific version

# Conventions:
# 1. Add comments (using #) before parameterized strings, explaining the parameters
#    (including {0} and @comm style params)
# 2. Try to give the strings names that would make sense from a UI perspective, not Java perspective
# 3. Copy this header to each locale
# 4. Strings in default file (AppletResources.properties) should match en_US version, prefixed with ???

# TODO: references to Windows Vista s/b updated to include Windows 7.
